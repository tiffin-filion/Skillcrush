[Jubilee Project](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/101-html-css/jubilee/index.html) - I had a bit of direction, but I started to learn how to develop a static web page from a PSD.

[Rogue Project](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/101-html-css/rogue/index.html) - I learned how to develop a static web page with nothing but a PSD file for guidance.

[Final Project](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/101-html-css/final/index.html) - I was given the choice of a few layouts and the PSD for each. I then had to recreate the page and then change the design (colors, fonts, images, content, etc) to my liking. I also added a second page that showed more projects that I've completed.
