# colors-starter
I just had to add different colors for each type of viewport (mobile, tablet and desktop) so you could see the change as the page size/viewport size changed. Page was created mobile first.

# breakpoint-starter
Page was created mobile first. Add breakpoints for tablets: 768px and desktops: 1200px. Add color for each to verify they are functioning correctly.

# font-color-starter
Page was created mobile first. Change h1, h2 and p as the page resizes from mobile to tablet to desktop.
