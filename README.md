[Jubilee Project](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/Skillcrush/skillcrush_jubilee_project/index.html) - I was given a PSD, jpg as well as directions to create this page.

[Rogue Project](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/Skillcrush/skillcrush_rogue_project/index.html)

[Final Project](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/Skillcrush/final_project/index.html) - I was given the choice of a few layouts and the PSD for each. I then had to recreate the page and then change the design (colors, fonts, images, content, etc) to my liking. I also added a second page that showed more projects that I've completed.
